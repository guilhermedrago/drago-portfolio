    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <div class="about-section">
        <p class="about-description">
            Doces Coloridos is a small company founded by a couple who, after facing difficulties in finding an affordable party organizer for their daughter’s birthday, were inspired to start their own business. Their mission is to provide affordable children's party services, including sweets, cakes, decorations, and face-painting, with a special emphasis on creating visually stunning cakes. I had the privilege of designing the logo for Doces Coloridos, ensuring it reflected the brand’s joyful and vibrant essence, in harmony with their goal of creating memorable and delightful experiences.

    <h1>Our Mission</h1>

    <div class="our-mission-section">
        <p class="our-mission-description">
            It is important for Doces Coloridos to present their event cakes in the best possible way. I was kindly invited to assist in addressing this by developing a solution through a workstation setup, and this was the final product developed.
